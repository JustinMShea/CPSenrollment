##	## its handle. So,
##	## list.files()

##	> df.x
##	              X..i..
##	1  enrollment2006_hs

##	3  enrollment2007_hs
##	4                Rds
##	5  enrollment2008_hs
##	6                Rds
##	[...]
##	23 enrollment2017_hs
##	24               Rds
##	
##	Filter out the Rds and give the result a name:
##	df.handles <- filter(df.x, !str_detect(X..i.., "Rds"))
##	
##	Give the df variable a better name, and clean up:
##	
##	df.handles$handle <- df.handles$X..i..
##	df.handles <- select(df.handles, handle)
##	## 
##	enrollment2006_hs <-  read_rds("./output/Rds/enrollment2006_hs.Rds")
##	
##	Now we want something like handle <- read_rds("handle.Rds")
##	Be sure to include a path argument!!!

# The first set that needs common_names constructed is 2009. The idea is to take
# the most recent set of common_name, from 2008, and match that by school_id,
# then manually add the ones not present in the earlier year. The procedure
# comes from RDS p.179, which actually is a digression in a discussion of
# mutating joins. I would have used a mutating join here, but the result was
# very untidy. It is less work for now to do it this way. This command correctly
# identified the matches from the 2008 data and inserted them into a new 
# variable in the 2009 set, with NA values for schools not in 2009:
